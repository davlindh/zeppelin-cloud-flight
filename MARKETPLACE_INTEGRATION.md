# Marketplace Integration Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of the Auction Emporium service into the main Zeppelin Inn website as an internal marketplace app.

## Completed Steps

### âœ… 1. Database Migration
- **File Created**: `supabase/migrations/20250107000000_add_marketplace_tables.sql`
- **Tables Added**:
  - Products system (products, product_variants, product_reviews)
  - Auctions system (auctions, bid_history)
  - Services system (services, service_providers, bookings, service_reviews, service_portfolio_items)
  - Categories system (categories, category_metadata)
  - Communication system (communication_requests)
- **Features**:
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for public read/admin write
  - Automatic timestamp updates via triggers
  - Stock status management
  - Atomic bid placement function
  - Performance indexes
  - Storage buckets for images

### âœ… 2. Routing Structure
- **Main App Updated**: `src/App.tsx`
- **Route Pattern**: `/marketplace/*`
  - `/marketplace` - Main marketplace index
  - `/marketplace/auctions` - Auctions listing
  - `/marketplace/auctions/:id` - Auction detail
  - `/marketplace/shop` - Products listing
  - `/marketplace/shop/:id` - Product detail
  - `/marketplace/services` - Services listing
  - `/marketplace/services/:id` - Service detail
  - `/marketplace/cart` - Shopping cart
  - `/marketplace/wishlist` - User wishlist

  - Marketplace footer

- **MarketplaceIndex**: `src/pages/marketplace/MarketplaceIndex.tsx`
  - Landing page with three main sections
  - Visual cards for Auctions, Shop, and Services
  - Link back to main site

### âœ… 4. Context Providers
Three marketplace-specific context providers created:

- **WishlistContext**: `src/contexts/marketplace/WishlistContext.tsx`
  - Add/remove items from wishlist
  - Check if item is in wishlist
  - LocalStorage persistence

- **CartProvider**: `src/contexts/marketplace/CartProvider.tsx`
  - Add/remove items from cart
  - Update quantities
  - Calculate totals
  - LocalStorage persistence

- **NotificationProvider**: `src/contexts/marketplace/NotificationProvider.tsx`
  - Add notifications
  - Mark as read
  - Track unread count
  - LocalStorage persistence

### âœ… 5. Navigation Integration
- **Header Updated**: `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
  - "Marketplace" link added next to Zeppel Inn logo
  - Visible on desktop, hidden on small mobile screens
  - Maintains consistent styling with main nav

## Next Steps

### ðŸ“‹ To Do

1. **Deploy Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # If using Supabase CLI locally
   supabase db reset
   
   # Or push the migration to production
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Copy Marketplace Components**
   - Copy auction components from `service-auction-emporium-d4c4dedc/src/components/auctions/`
   - Copy shop components from `service-auction-emporium-d4c4dedc/src/components/shop/`
   - Copy services components from `service-auction-emporium-d4c4dedc/src/components/services/`
   - Update all import paths to match new structure

3. **Copy Marketplace Pages**
   - Copy and adapt pages from `service-auction-emporium-d4c4dedc/src/pages/`
   - Update routes to use copied pages instead of placeholder divs
   - Ensure all Supabase queries point to correct tables

4. **Copy Marketplace Hooks**
   - Copy custom hooks from `service-auction-emporium-d4c4dedc/src/hooks/`
   - Adapt hooks to use new context providers
   - Update Supabase client imports

5. **Install Dependencies** (if needed)
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

6. **Test Integration**
   - Start development server: `npm run dev`
   - Navigate to `/marketplace`
   - Test all three sections (Auctions, Shop, Services)
   - Verify cart and wishlist functionality
   - Test navigation between main site and marketplace

7. **Update Admin Dashboard** (future)
   - Add marketplace management section
   - Create admin panels for:
     - Products management
     - Auctions management
     - Services management
     - Bookings management

## File Structure

## Database Schema Summary

### Products
- Full e-commerce product system
- Variant support (size, color, material)
- Review and rating system
- Stock management with automatic updates

### Auctions
- Real-time bidding system
- Atomic bid placement function
- Bid history tracking
- Auction status management

### Services
- Service provider profiles
- Service bookings
- Portfolio items
- Review system

### Categories
- Unified hierarchical system
- Category metadata with icons and colors
- Shared across all marketplace sections

## Environment Variables

Both apps share the same Supabase configuration:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://paywaomkmjssbtkzwnwd.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[your-key]
```

## Design Decisions

1. **URL Structure**: Chose `/marketplace/*` pattern for clear separation
2. **Branding**: Full "Zeppel Inn" branding throughout marketplace
3. **Categories**: Unified hierarchical system for all content
4. **Navigation**: Marketplace link prominently next to logo
5. **Contexts**: Separate marketplace contexts to avoid conflicts

## Known Issues

- TypeScript errors in new files are expected until `node_modules` are installed
- Placeholder pages need to be replaced with actual components
- Admin integration is not yet complete

## Migration Notes

- All auction emporium tables have been prefixed or namespaced appropriately
- No table name conflicts with existing main site tables
- RLS policies match existing security model
- Storage buckets follow existing naming convention
